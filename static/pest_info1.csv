0,Codling Moth,"The codling moth (Cydia pomonella) is a member of the Lepidopteran family Tortricidae. They are major pests to agricultural crops, mainly fruits such as apples and pears. Because the larvae are not able to feed on leaves, they are highly dependent on fruits as a food source and thus have a significant impact on crops. The caterpillars bore into fruit and stop it from growing, which leads to premature ripening. Various means of control, including chemical, biological, and preventive, have been implemented. This moth has a widespread distribution, being found on six continents. Adaptive behavior such as diapause and multiple generations per breeding season have allowed this moth to persist even during years of bad climatic conditions.","Codling moth can be treated with an all-purpose fruit tree insecticide, or with insecticides containing pyrethroids (permethrin, esfenvalerate), or carbaryl (Sevin).Products with Spinosyn are based on the soil bacterium called Saccharopolyspora spinosa which is toxic to insects like codling moth but safe for most beneficial insects as well as for humans, pets, and the environment. It requires repeated applications for each codling moth generation and per product label, there is a limit on the number of applications per season. "
1,Oriental fruit fly,"Bactrocera dorsalis, previously known as Dacus dorsalis and commonly referred to as the oriental fruit fly, is a species of tephritid fruit fly that is endemic to Southeast Asia. It is one of the major pest species in the genus Bactrocera with a broad host range of cultivated and wild fruits. Male B. dorsalis respond strongly to methyl eugenol, which is used to monitor and estimate populations, as well as to annihilate males as a form of pest control. They are also important pollinators and visitors of wild orchids, Bulbophyllum cheiri and Bulbophyllum vinaceum in Southeast Asia, which lure the flies using methyl eugenol.The fly is similar to the closely related species B. carambolae and B. occipitalis. The species name B. dorsalis is identical to other synonyms B. papayae, B. invadens and B. philippinensis.

","Naled-intoxicated methyl eugenol (ME) is commonly used to control oriental fruit flies, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae), in Taiwan. However, non-responsiveness to ME and pesticide resistance in oriental fruit flies may reduce control efficacy. In this study, mark-recapture experiments were used to analyze the effects of naled-intoxicated ME on field and naled-resistant fly strains. ME non-responsiveness was tested in field, naled-resistant, and susceptible strains and pyrosequencing techniques were used to detect frequencies of point mutations on organophosphate resistant alleles in field strains. Finally, the effects of fipronil-intoxicated ME were analyzed to determine whether control efficiency could be enhanced through the use of alternate pesticides. "
2,Mole cricket,"Mole crickets are members of the insect family Gryllotalpidae, in the order Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets). Mole crickets are cylindrical-bodied, fossorial insects about 3‚Äì5 cm (1.2‚Äì2.0 in) long as adults, with small eyes and shovel-like fore limbs highly developed for burrowing. They are present in many parts of the world and where they have arrived in new regions, may become agricultural pests.
Mole crickets have three life stages: eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most of their lives in these stages are spent underground, but adults have wings and disperse in the breeding season. They vary in their diet: some species are herbivores, mainly feeding on roots; others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet; and a few are largely predatory.
In Zambia, mole crickets are thought to bring good fortune, while in Latin America, they are said to predict rain. In Florida, where Neoscapteriscus mole crickets are not native, they are considered pests, and various biological controls have been used. Gryllotalpa species have been used as food in West Java, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines.","To repel mole crickets, you can plant different types of flowers, such as marigolds, calendula or chrysanthemums between your vegetable crops. Mole crickets are easier to control when damage is less evident, which means that the eggs are not laid yet or the nymphs are still young, and have not managed to do much damage. After testing the soil for their presence, with a mixture of soap and water, you can proceed in applying insecticides, to make sure the infestation does not develop and spread."
3,Leafhopper,"A leafhopper is the common name for any species from the family Cicadellidae. These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and carrier of pheromones. They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas. The family is distributed  all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species.
They belong to a lineage traditionally treated as infraorder Cicadomorpha in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, but as the latter taxon is probably not monophyletic, many modern authors prefer to abolish the Auchenorrhyncha and elevate the cicadomorphs to a suborder Clypeorrhyncha. Members of the tribe Proconiini of the subfamily Cicadellinae are commonly known as sharpshooters.","The eggs of some leafhopper species are parasitised by tiny wasps. Damsel bugs, ladybirds, lacewing larvae and spiders feed on leafhoppers.If you have fruit-bearing plants, vegetables or flowers, you should apply Viper Insect Dust. Viper Insect Dust is a pesticide dust that can be safely applied to fruit-bearing trees, vegetables, and garden plants such as sweet corn, potatoes, apples, celery and lettuce. It contains the active ingredient Permethrin and delivers a quick knockdown to Leaf Hoppers which come in contact with it."
4,Locusts,"Locusts (derived from the Vulgar Latin locusta, meaning grasshopper) are a group of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions.
Normally, these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low, and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs that later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.Locusts have formed plagues since prehistory. The ancient Egyptians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the Iliad, the Mahabharata, and the Bible. Swarms have devastated crops and have been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control are based on the use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.","Use biopesticides to kill locusts without hurting the environment. The Metarhizium anisopliae fungus is a green alternative to insecticides. Research shows that, when sprayed over crops, these spores can kill 70-90% of locusts in a 2-3 week period without harming other plants and bugs.Bait helps you kill off locusts before they grow wings.Drape insect mesh or shadecloth on top of your prized garden plants.Locust swarms may break up if they hear loud noises."
5,Cabbage butterfly,"Pieris rapae is a small- to medium-sized butterfly species of the whites-and-yellows family Pieridae. It is known in Europe as the small white, in North America as the cabbage white or cabbage butterfly, on several continents as the small cabbage white, and in New Zealand as the white butterfly. The butterfly is recognizable by its white color with small black dots on its wings, and it can be distinguished from P. brassicae by the smaller size and lack of the black band at the tip of their forewings.
The caterpillar of this species, often referred to as the ""imported cabbageworm"", is a pest to crucifer crops such as cabbage, kale, bok choy and broccoli. Pieris rapae is widespread in Europe and Asia; it is believed to have originated in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Europe, and to have spread across Eurasia thanks to the diversification of brassicaceous crops and the development of human trade routes. Over the past two centuries, it spread to North Africa, North America, New Zealand, and Australia, as a result of accidental introductions.","Biological control is a natural way to eliminate the larva of the cabbage white butterfly, the use of ladybugs and lacewings are considered beneficial insects and will feed on the larva of the cabbage white butterfly. Installing plants in your gardens such as yellow button flowers, fennels, sweet alyssum, zinnias, cosmos white sensation, tansy, coriander, purple poppy mallow, dandelion, basket of gold, common yellow, and carpet bugleweed is a great choice. These plants will attract ladybugs and lacewings. This natural method of ridding your garden of insect pests is known as companion planting."
6,Snail,"A snail is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod. The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word ""snail"" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called slugs, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs.","Tilling the soil should also be included in your list of actions to prevent and control snails. This will expose the snails that are possibly overwintering or hiding under the ground. Be sure to handpick them and throw them in a bucket of soapy water. By doing this, you will prevent them from finding their way back to their host plant.Setting out traps in the garden is another effective way to control the population of snails.Grow plants that can resist snails. Some of the examples of the latter include snapdragon, fennel, day lilies, house leeks, and nasturtiums, among others. "
7,Cotton leafworm,"Spodoptera litura, otherwise known as the tobacco cutworm or cotton leafworm, is a nocturnal moth in the family Noctuidae. S. litura is a serious polyphagous pest in Asia, Oceania, and the Indian subcontinent that was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. Its common names reference two of the most frequent host plants of the moth. In total, 87 species of host plants that are infested by S. litura are of economic importance. The species parasitize the plants through the larvae vigorous eating patterns, oftentimes leaving the leaves completely destroyed. The moth's effects are quite disastrous, destroying economically important agricultural crops and decreasing yield in some plants completely. Their potential impact on the many different cultivated crops, and subsequently the local agricultural economy, has led to serious efforts to control the pests.S. litura is often confused with its close relative, Spodoptera littoralis. These two species are hard to discriminate between because the larvae and adult forms are identical. Inspecting the genitalia is the most certain way to tell the two species apart.

","Damage from cutworms in tobacco is relatively rare and post transplant foliar insecticides can be very effective, so preventative insecticide use pretransplant is not recommended. Management is recommended if 10% of plants are clipped. If less than 10% of plants die due to insect feeding, treatment is not necessary."
8,Stink bug,"The brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) is an insect in the family Pentatomidae, native to China, Japan, Korea and other Asian regions. In September 1998 it was collected in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where it is believed to have been accidentally introduced. The nymphs and adults of the brown marmorated stink bug feed on over 100 species of plants, including many agricultural crops, and by 2010‚Äì11 had become a season-long pest in orchards in the Eastern United States. In 2010, in the Mid-Atlantic United States, $37 million in apple crops were lost, and some stone fruit growers lost more than 90% of their crops. It is now established in many parts of North America, and has recently become established in Europe and South America.

",Soap and water have been used as a sprayer directly on Stink bugs with some degree of success. A spray with equal parts liquid soap and water can be used directly on Stink bugs to kill them or slow them down until you can remove them by hand.Vacuum cleaners can be used to suck up these bugs in a bag. This bag needs to be sealed and discarded afterward as Stink bugs donít die when vacuumed.
9,Weevil,"Weevils, also referred to as nunus, are beetles belonging to the superfamily Curculionoidea, known for their elongated snouts. They are usually small, less than 6 mm (1‚ÅÑ4 in) in length, and herbivorous. Approximately 97,000 species of weevils are known. They belong to several families, with most of them in the family Curculionidae (the true weevils). Some other beetles, although not closely related, bear the name ""weevil"", such as the biscuit weevil (Stegobium paniceum), which belongs to the family Ptinidae.
Many weevils are considered pests because of their ability to damage and kill crops. The grain or wheat weevil (Sitophilus granarius) damages stored grain, as does the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) among others. The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) attacks cotton crops; it lays its eggs inside cotton bolls and the larvae eat their way out. Other weevils are used for biological control of invasive plants.
A weevil's rostrum, or elongated snout, hosts chewing mouthparts instead of the piercing mouthparts that proboscis-possessing insects are known for. The mouthparts are often used to excavate tunnels into grains. In more derived weevils, the rostrum has a groove in which the weevil can fold the first segment of its antennae.

","As mentioned, we recommend heading into your garden at night and using a flashlight to locate the weevils. Wearing gloves, manually remove the adult insects, larvae and eggs, and place into a container of soapy water to destroy. If an entire plant or row of crops are entirely infested, It can be resolved by complete removal and destruction of the whole plant to prevent the spreading of the insects."
