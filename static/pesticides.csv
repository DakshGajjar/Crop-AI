pest , chemical control , biological/cultural control
rice leaf roller , Use alpha-cypermethrin or Abamectin 2% or Cartap hydrochloride. , Use thorn wood on the leaves to chase insects away Avoid ratooning (leaving the cut tillers for the next season). 
rice leaf caterpillar , Spray flubendiamide @ 0.1ml or chlorantraniliprole @ 0.3ml/l of water. , Natural biological control agents often keep the larval population under control like  the eggs are parasitized by trichogrammatid wasps. Chalcid wasp and two species of tachinid flies parasitize the larvae and a vespid wasp preys on the larvae.
paddy stem maggot , Soak the seedling roots in 0.02% Chlorpyriphos for 12 to 14 hrs before transplanting. , Setup light trap and monitor the adult flies.
asiatic rice borer , Apply granular chemical insecticides like Fipronil 0.3G @25kg/ha or chlorpyriphos or chlorpyriphos-methyl 10G @ 10kg/ha. , Install the pheromone traps from 15 days after transplanting @3/acre or 8/acre based on the insect pest population.
yellow rice borer , Spray Chlorpyriphos 20 EC @2lt/ha or Fipronil 5SC @0.8t/ha or chlorantraniliprole3ml/lt water at threshold intervals. , As the borer lays eggs on the leaf tip - cut the tips before transplanting.
rice gall midge , Spraying with Cypermethrin 10 EC or Phosphamidon 100 EC @ 1.5 ml/L of water. , Plow ratoon of the previous crop and remove all off-season plant hosts.
Rice Stemfly , Carbaryl Quinalphos and Phosphamidon and granules of Quinalphos should be sprayed. , The grasses found on the bundhs around the paddy field should be destroyed.
brown plant hopper, Spray insecticides formulations like Buprofezin- Prometrozin or other alternative insecticides. , Sweep the nursery seedling bed with a net to remove the BPH.
white backed plant hopper, Avoid spraying of insecticides like chlorpyrifos or pyrethroid combinations or lambda-cyhalothrin as it favors for the resurgence and resistance of the insect pest. , Natural enemies like egg parasitoids and mired bugs and water striders and spiders prey on the hopper.
small brown plant hopper , Spray insecticides formulations like Buprofezin or Prometrozin or other alternative insecticides. , Sweep the nursery seedling bed with a net to remove the BPH.
rice water weevil , Compounds  like the pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin are commonly used against rice water weevil. , Draining rice fields was the first recommended treatment for dealing with rice water weevil because it was assumed that soil dryness contributed to mortality.
rice leafhopper , Use alpha-cypermethrin or Abamectin 2% or Cartap hydrochloride. , Small plot studies in rice paddies have shown a spider - Pardosa ramulosa - to significantly reduce populations of the aster leafhopper. 
grain spreader thrips , pyrethrin-There are several pesticides containing various amounts of pyrethrins - Check each label for the use and amount needed. Some formulations are OMRI-listed for organic use. , Natural enemies including predaceous mites and minute pirate bugs and lacewings are often found feeding on thrips.
rice shell pest , Chlorinated hydrocarbons were first used and then phosphates and recently the carbamates have been used. , Numerous parasitoids have been reported attacking the eggs and larvae.
grub, Preventive products containing imidacloprid or thiamethoxam or clothianidin will consistently reduce 75-100% of the grubs if they are applied in June or July and if they are watered-in with 0.5 inches of irrigation immediately after application. , Milky spore (Bacillus popilliae) is a bacteria that can naturally kill Japanese beetle grubs. 
mole cricket , Important active ingredients for mole cricket insecticides as bifenthrin or carbaryl or imidacloprid or gramma cyhalothrin or deltamethrin or permethrin. , Popular biological controls that have found success in controlling mole cricket populations naturally are certain species of nematodes or worm-like parasites.
wireworm , Insecticides against wireworms include products with bifenthrin and pyrethrins and and zeta-cypermethrin as active ingredients. , Another form of biological control is to introduce Steinernema carpocapsae to your soil before planting. 
white margined moth , Spray plants with Dipel , Pathogens including viruses such as Baculovirus and Cypovirus can infect and kill larvae.
black cutworm , A wash of bleach-free dish soap and water on your plants can also help to stop cutworms from attacking the plants. , Use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) - a naturally occurring bacterium that target many caterpillar-type pests.
large cutworm , Sevin dust has been shown to be effective against cutworms because they’ll come into contact with the dust as they’re foraging for food. , You can sprinkle a ring of Epsom salt around the base of the plant This way they have to crawl over the ring of salt to reach the plant.
yellow cutworm , Permethrin and Chlorpyrifos based pesticides , Grow plants that can attract predators such as such as toads fireflies or moles or meadowlarks or black birds.
red spider , red spider mite control chemicals include Dicofol (MOA 20) and Deltamethrin (MOA 3) and Fluvalinate (MOA 3) and Etoxazole (MOA 10B) and the Fenypyroximate (MOA 21). ,Use Lacewings and ladybugs as well as predatory mites can also be used.
corn borer , Treat crops with Bacillus thuringiensis which is a naturally occurring bacteria that acts as an insecticide. , Lacewings and lady beetles will eat pests so they don't damage your crop and can be purchased from many home and garden stores as well as Frogs & birds and spiders also will feast on the pests.
army worm , Applications of Garden Dust (Bt-kurstaki) or OMRI-listed Monterey Garden Insect Spray (spinosad) will kill caterpillars. , Other beneficial insects such as lacewing and ladybugs and minute pirate bugs feed on armyworm eggs as well as the young larval stage. 
aphids , Insecticidal soap and horticultural oils can provide effective control if applied thoroughly. , Small wasps that lay their eggs inside of aphids are among their most important natural enemies and A parasitized aphid becomes brittle and golden brown as it turns into a form called a mummy moreover Most parasitoids reproduce rapidly when the weather is warm so when you begin to see mummies on your plants - the aphid population is likely to drop dramatically within a week or two.
